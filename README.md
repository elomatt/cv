## Summary
Experimental physics research provides me with a unique opportunity to apply creative problem-solving skills to tangible challenges, and the real-world technologies which our research feeds into provides an enormous sense of meaning and motivation. As my career progresses I am always trying to develop myself as a researcher and to find ways of applying what physics teaches us.

## Research Experience
### Post-doctoral Researcher (May 2017–Present)
University of Seconded permanently to the National Physical Laboratory, I worked in a Birmingham multi-disciplinary team to deliver a next-generation portable optical lattice clock.
### Post-doctoral Researcher (May 2016–May 2017)
University of As a post-doc in the Integrated Atom Chips group I continued supporting the Southampton research of the group which I had started during my PhD. My responsibilities included supervision of students and writing grant proposals.
### Postgraduate Researcher (Oct 2012–May 2016)
Thesis: Enabling Technologies for Integrated Atom Chips My PhD focused on cold atom technology transfer and on techniques for
sealing the vacuum chambers of integrated atom chips.
### Research Student (Jun 2012–Oct 2012)
University of Designing and building a semi-automated Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Exeter (MOKE) microscope for use in analysis of nano-antennas and assessment of their enhancement of magnetisation measurements.
### Research Student (Jun 2011–Sep 2011)
Developing a new image acquisition program using LabVIEW to take automated hyper-spectral stacks of organic samples using Raman spectroscopy techniques.

## Education Experience
### 1st Year Labs Demonstrator (2013–2016)
University of This position has helped me improve my sensitivity to the needs associated Southampton with different learning styles and has really boosted my communication skills.
### Freelance Private Tuition (2011-Present)
An independent private tutor teaching Maths, Physics, French and Violin, I travel across the south of England helping GCSE and A Level students improve their understanding.

## Recent Education
### MPhys Physics with European Study (2008-2012)
University of Exeter *First Class Honours* School: Physics and Astronomy
Thesis: Investigation into a new nano-antenna for exploring magnetism at the nano-scale
Description: This thesis explored technologies for improving magnetic imaging techniques, and rounded off a degree during which I learned valuable analysis skills and spent a year living and studying independently at the Universit´e de Rennes 1.
Advisors: Prof. Rob Hicken
